# SafeSpeak

**HACK AI Hackathon Submission | April 2025**

## Project Overview
SafeSpeak is a high-impact application developed to provide a secure and objective resource for victims of domestic abuse. The primary mission is to leverage the power of Artificial Intelligence to help users objectively identify, document, and process patterns of toxic and abusive behavior they experience.

Victims often struggle with self-doubt and gaslighting. SafeSpeak acts as a confidential, neutral third party by analyzing user-provided summaries of interactions. This feature helps validate the user's feelings and experiences, which is a critical step toward realizing the severity of the situation and seeking help. The app is not a substitute for professional legal or psychological help but serves as an important initial documentation and awareness tool.

## Features
### Toxic Behavior Analysis: 
- Utilizes a Toxic BERT model to analyze user-inputted text (summaries of interactions) for various categories of toxicity and abuse.

### Confidential User Interface: 
- A simple, discreet, and private interface for recording and reviewing journal entries.

### Data Security: 
- Built with a secure backend to protect sensitive user data.

### Resource Integration (Future Scope): 
- Potential for connecting users with local support services and emergency contacts.

## Tech Stack
### Node.js
- Provides a fast, scalable, and non-blocking server environment to handle concurrent user requests.

### Express.js
- Acts as the flexible framework for defining API routes, handling user info, and serving the application.

### MongoDB
- A flexible NoSQL database used to store user accounts and their journal entries/analysis results.
